# TypeScript Essentials

This repository contains simple TypeScript projects and tests created for **learning purposes**.

Iâ€™m currently starting my experience as a software engineer, and this repo is part of my journey to practise:
- **TypeScript fundamentals**
- **Unit testing with Jest**
- **Mocking and test-driven development (TDD)**

Feel free to explore the code as I continue to grow my skills!
